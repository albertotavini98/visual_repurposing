# visual_repurposing
This is a python repository with some code i developed to do what i call "visual repurposing", so an algorithmic equivalent of what pop art exponents used to do: combine pieces of already existing art to create new art. It is meant to extract pieces of pictures and combine them on a background as to create visually stimulating images.

There is also an application of K-means clustering as to group the pieces that we then glue to the background chromatically speaking. We use the average on the RGB channels as three features for clustering input
